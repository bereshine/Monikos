    "Mechanism of Action": [
        "Lovastatin, a cholesterol lowering agent, is rapidly hydrolyzed to beta-hydroxyacid which is an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase. It prevents the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate which is rate limiting step in the biosynthesis of cholesterol. Its low-density lipoprotein (LDL) lowering effect may involve reduction of very low density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C) concentration and induction of the LDL receptor [7]"
